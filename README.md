# CarParkingProject
AOA, I have created a console based Car Parking Project written in Java Language for my OOP final Project.
THe project can enter the number of vehicles that have entered into the building for parking, you can view the records, delete the records, view the records of individual types of vehicles i.e. Rickshaws, cars and buses and you can delete the records of all the vehicles as well as individuals records. 
I have uploaded the project proposal, report and problems because of which i created this software.
